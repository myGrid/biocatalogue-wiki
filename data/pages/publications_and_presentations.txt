1- Damian Smedley et al., in their paper, [[http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2010/0/baq014|Finding and sharing: new approaches to registries of databases and services for the biomedical sciences]] emphasized the usefulness of the BioCatalogue for the community and advocated the use of the registry by all service providers to publish their services.

3- Javier Ríos and colleagues mention in their paper, [[http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1840111|Magallanes: a web services discovery and automatic workflow composition tool]], the need to integrate Magallanes and the BioCatalogue.  

4- Michael Gruenberge et al., in their paper, [[http://hzi.openrepository.com/hzi/handle/10033/96658 |Towards the integration of mouse databases - definition and implementation of solutions to two use-cases in mouse functional genomics]], favor the idea to submit to the BioCatalogue any web services developed during the course of their project.
