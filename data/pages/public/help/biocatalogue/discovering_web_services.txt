====== Discovering Web Services in the BioCatalogue ======

**The Problem: ** //"Web Services are hard to find..."//

**So...**

  * Find the right Web Service using the BioCatalogue
  * We offer easy and powerful search and filtering interfaces
  * We index metadata made available by service providers, expert curators and the wider community



When searching for services in the BioCatalogue there is an auto suggestion based on the content of the catalogue and previous searches by users. 
Search terms are case insensitive and can be combined with AND. e.g. Blast AND Protein 

In addition, when searching for bioinformatic terms e.g. microarray, the BioCatalogue will automatically include in your search query any related terms e.g. affymetrix, probeset, etc. The [[http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/service-management/mygrid-ontology/|myGrid ontology]] is used to define the relationship between terms. 

===== Search by Data =====
You can search for services that might analyse or process your data using the [[http://www.biocatalogue.org/search/by_data|search for data]] feature. For example, given a sequence in fasta format, it returns a list of services that possibly consume sequences in fasta format. \\
The "Search by data" depends on example inputs and outputs of service operations in BioCatalogue. It is based on the
[[http://filequirks.genesilico.pl/|FileQuirks]] algorithm. 

===== Service filtering =====
Web Services in the BioCatalogue can be filtered by: 
  * Service type: SOAP or REST 
  * Service category: services are grouped based on their functions. 
  * Service provider: e.g NCBI, EBI, DDBJ
  * Submitter: registries or Members who submitted the service 
  * Country of Origin: where is the service hosted. 

If you enable the tag filter, you can also filter services by: 
  * Tags on services 
  * Tags on service operations
  * Tags on service inputs 
  * Tags on service outputs 

Note that you can combine different filter. e.g.
