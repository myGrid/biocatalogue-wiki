Damian Smedley et al., in their paper, **[[http://database.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/2010/0/baq014|Finding and sharing: new approaches to registries of databases and services for the biomedical sciences]]** emphasized the usefulness of the BioCatalogue for the community and advocated the use of the registry by all service providers to publish their services.

3. Javier Ríos and colleagues mention in their paper, **[[http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1840111|Magallanes: a web services discovery and automatic workflow composition tool]]**, the need to integrate Magallanes and the BioCatalogue.
