====== The BioCatalogue work plan for 2011 ======

For 2011 we plan to work on the following features, which will be prioritised based on users' feedback and requests. 
To have your say, please join the [[http://listserv.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=biocatalogue-friends&A=1|BioCatalogue-Friends Mailing List]]
 
===== Functional Units (FU) =====
  * Functional/task view over web services
  * FUs as conﬁgurations and compositions of underlying service operations that can then be described, annotated and searched for

 ===== Improving search capabilities and user interface =====
  * “People who searched for this also searched for x”
  * Consolidating the filtering and search user interfaces

===== Improving the annotations mechanism =====
  * Incorporating the EDAM ontology
  * Richer annotation fields (choice-based, semantic chooser, suggestions, etc.

===== Better curation reports and tools for expert curators =====
  * Improving the curation dashboard and annotating features

===== “Try it now” service functionality =====
  * Ability to test and play with a service within the BioCatalogue interface e.g. run SOAP operations or REST endpoints directly

===== Curator community features =====
  * Improving support for curators and building a community of curators e.g. curator invites and reward badges
  * Annotation status bar: a status bar to display the overall annotation status of a service. 

===== More customisable and brand-able system =====
  * More and more people are deploying their own instance using the BioCatalogue software
  * Need to make the software more customisable as well as more robust
  * Need to make it easier to configure images, styles, colours etc

===== Integration with myExperiment =====
  * Services from BioCatalogue displayed in myExperiment so users of myExperiment can browse them. 
  * Workflows in myExperiment will have links to the relevant services, with metadata and monitoring status pulled from BioCatalogue.

===== Better service filtering and ranking =====
  * Ability to filter or rank service based on annotations, quality, curators etc.
  
===== Service versions =====
  * Support for different versions of a service (i.e.: SOAP and REST versions of a single service).

===== Notifications and news feeds per service ===== 
  * RSS/ATOM feeds for services, providing information on all activity on a service within the BioCatalogue.
