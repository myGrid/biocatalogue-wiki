====== Registering Web Services in the BioCatalogue ======
Any registered users (members) can submit any Web Service to the BioCatalogue.  
You do not have to be the provider of the service to submit it to the BioCatalogue. Click [[http://test.biocatalogue.org/signup|here]] to become a Member of the BioCatalogue. \\

Currently the BioCatalogue support **SOAP**, **REST** and **Soaplab** services. 

===== Submitting SOAP service to the BioCatalogue =====
Given that most existing SOAP services have a WSDL document, registering a SOAP service entry into the BioCatalogue requires only the WSDL url. The BioCatalogue WSDL parser automatically structures the data from the WSDL file. To submit a SOAP service with a defined WSDL file:  
  * Select 'SOAP' from the 'Register a Service' page in the BioCatalogue
  * Paste your WSDL url in the form and click preview 
  * Provide additional description to the service. This is optional but very useful. You may add these descriptions after you submit the service
  * Click 'Submit' to submit your service
Once the service is successfully submitted you can add more annotation (descriptions, tags, example values) to the service and its operations, inputs or outputs. 

===== Submitting REST service to the BioCatalogue =====
The BioCatalogue has a basic support for REST service. To submit a REST service all you need is the REST endpoint and the service name. 
  * Select 'REST' from the 'Register a Service' page in the BioCatalogue
  * Paste the endpoint URL 
  * Provide a name for the service
  * Provide additional description for the service. This is optional but very useful. You may add these descriptions after you submit the service
  * Click 'Submit' to submit your service 
Once the service is successfully submitted you can add more annotation (descriptions, tags, example values) to the service

===== Submitting Soaplab service to the BioCatalogue =====
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soaplab|Soaplab]] service are command line application wrapped as Web Services. 
  * To submit a soaplab 1 service:
     * From the soaplab server which may look like <base URL/axis/services> look for 'AnalysisFactory' and copy the corresponding WSDL
     * Select 'Soaplab Server' from the 'Register a Service' page in the BioCatalogue
     * Paste the WSDL URL you have copied in the form and click preview
     * Click 'Submit' to submit your service
  
  * To submit a soaplab 2 service:
    * From the soaplab server copy the WSDL ending with <services/list?wsdl>
    * Select 'Soaplab Server' from the 'Register a Service' page in the BioCatalogue
    * Paste the WSDL URL you have copied in the form and click preview
    * Click 'Submit' to submit your service

Note that it may take a little while for all services to be registered.\\
Once the service is successfully submitted you can add more annotation (descriptions, tags, example values) to the service and its operations, inputs or outputs.
