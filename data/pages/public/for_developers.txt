The BioCatalogue project is building an open platform for Web Services registration, annotation and monitoring. The **[[http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=6901|codebase]]** that powers the **[[http://www.biocatalogue.org|BioCatalogue]]** is **[[http://biocatalogue.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/license.txt|BSD licensed]]** and therefore free to download, run and develop (see: **[[development:installation|installation]]**).

As well as the web interface, you can access much of the data and functionality via a public **[[public:api|REST API]]** (currently read only). With this API you can integrate the BioCatalogue into your own tools and environments.

Information about **[[Development: Codebase Guidelines|working with the BioCatalogue codebase]]** is available. 

**[[development:release_notes|Release notes]]** are also available for those updating their instances.

Further below on this page we will be adding detailed design and implementation information for those interested in knowing more about the internals of the BioCatalogue system.

<!-- The rest of the **[[Development:|development docs/notes]]** are available too. Note that these are a work in progress and/or rough notes. -->

The public **[[http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/biocatalogue-hackers|biocatalogue-hackers mailing list]]** is for those interested in developing with the BioCatalogue REST API and/or codebase. Please do join and post your questions/feedback/suggestions.

You can also **[[http://www.biocatalogue.org/contact|contact us]]** for any general queries.
