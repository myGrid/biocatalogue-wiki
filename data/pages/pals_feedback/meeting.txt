==== Introduction ====
 
BioCatalogue is a **curated** registry of Life science services \\
Some challenges: \\ 
  * loads of web services using different technology (SOAP, REST)
  * different standard available 
  * get users and provider to annotate web services
 
The role of the Focus Group is to discuss the issues and propose some solutions. In addition the Focus Group provides feedback on the BioCatalogue products. 

==== Discussion ====
 
**1-Web service annotation in Life Science** \\
  * Use of controlled vocabulary
  * Service categorization 
  * Tag on service/operations/ inputs/outputs
  * Annotation quality matrix

**2-Community/provider involvements - How To** \\
  * Find different ways to add annotation to web service e.g through API
  * Possibility to import annotation from application using webs services such as Taverna, myExperiment etc.
  * Service providers or users should gain something in return. For example report the result of service testing to the provider.

**3-What do you expect from the BioCatalogue?** \\
  * An API to ease the deployment of services; possibility to do everything through the API (service and annotation submission, service testing and monitoring etc…).  
  * Integration with other tools consuming web service such as Taverna, myExperiment etc…
  * Link between inputs and outputs of services 
  * Monitor submitter contact details. With time, some of them will be out of date. For example when a service submitter leaves his project.
  * Define policy for service which have been offline for a long period of time 
  * BioCatalogue is serving 2 different communities; it should be clear from the site
    * Community 1 knows what web services are and wants to use them 
    * Community 2 wants to know more about web services. 
  * Possibility to rank search result based on service availability test.
  * Possibility to test web service from the BioCatalogue
  * Make it easy for user of the BioCatalogue to contact service provider
  * How do you know that the service is well annotated? Need a kind of BioCatalogue approved annotation stamp.
