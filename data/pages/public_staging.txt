The BioCatalogue is a curated registry of biological Web Services. [[http://www.biocatalogue.org|The BioCatalogue website]] is freely accessible to the world as it is searchable and indexable to search engines. It provides an open platform for biological Web Services registration, annotation and monitoring. 

**Our Goals**
  * Provide a single registration point for Web Service providers and a single search site for scientists and developers.
  * Providers, Expert curators and Users will provide oversight, monitor the catalogue and provide high quality annotations for services.
  * BioCatalogue as a place where the community can find, contact and meet the experts and maintainers of these services.

BioCatalogue is a BBSRC funded project and has been running since 1st June 2008. The project is a joint venture between the EMBL-EBI (led by Rodrigo Lopez) and the myGrid project at the University of Manchester (led by Carole Goble).
