====== News & Events ======

As we are trying hard to engage with the service providers as well as the consumer communities, we have traveled around the globe to promote our cause. We have been present at these following major events and plan more in the near future.

=== 2010 International Symposium on Integrative Bioinformatics, Cambridge, UK ===
Website: http://www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/bab/conf/ib2010/index.php

"Biological data are scattered across thousands of biological databases and hundreds of scientific journals. Current high throughput genomics technologies generate large quantities of high dimensional data. Microarray, NMR, mass spectrometry, protein chips, gel electrophoresis data, Yeast-Two-Hybrid, QTL mapping, gene silencing, and knockout experiments are all examples of technologies that capture thousands of data points, often in single experiments. The challenge for Integrative Bioinformatics is to capture, model, integrate, and analyse these data in a consistent way to provide new and deeper insights into complex biological systems."

Franck Tanoh presented a BioCatalogue [[http://www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/bab/conf/ib2010/posterpdfs/BioCatalogue-Poster34.pdf|poster]] at the event, 22-24 May 2010

=== All Hands Meeting 2009, Oxford, UK ===
"The meeting provides a forum in which information on e-Science projects from all disciplines can be communicated and where the capabilities being developed within projects can be demonstrated." \\

Two BioCatalogue demos were presented at the UK [[http://www.allhands.org.uk/ |e-Science All Hands meeting 2009]], December 2009
  * Monday 7th Dec by Jiten Bhagat
  * Tuesday 8th Dec by Jiten Bhagat
Poster presented at the conference by Jiten Bhagat: [[http://www.slideshare.net/BioCatalogue/ahm-2009-biocatalogue-poster|poster]]

=== Open House Festival of Interactive Technology 2009, Cambridge, UK ===
"The 23rd BCS conference on Human Computer Interaction celebrated the people who use technology, the people who create new technologies, and the relationship between them. A centrepiece of the conference was an Open House Festival involving the many Cambridge laboratories and startup companies now creating new displays, devices, games, communications and ubiquitous computing technologies. New developments in HCI depend on technology, and interchange between the communities provided influence in both directions."
  * Eric Nzuobontane presented a BioCatalogue [[http://www.slideshare.net/BioCatalogue/biocatalogue-poster|poster]] at the [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/conference/hci2009/index.html|workshop]], 02 September 2009
 
=== Data Integration in Life Sciences (DILS) 2009 - ENFIN Collocated Workshop, Manchester, UK ===
"[[http://intranet.cs.man.ac.uk/dils09//|DILS 2009]] is the sixth in a workshop series that aims at fostering discussion, exchange, and innovation in research and development in the areas of data integration and data management for the life sciences."
  * Jiten Bhagat and Franck Tanoh presented and demo the BioCatalogue, Manchester, UK, 20-22 July 2009. [[http://www.slideshare.net/BioCatalogue/biocatalogue-dils-enfin-2009-by-jits|Slides]]

=== Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) 2009, Stockholm, Sweden ===
"ISMB is a scientific meeting on the subjects of bioinformatics and computational biology. It has been held annually since 1993, and has grown to the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields"

[[http://www.biocatalogue.org/ |The BioCatalogue]] was officially launched  at [[http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/|ISMB 2009]]

  * Jiten Bhagat and Franck Tanoh demo the BioCatalogue on 1st July 2009. [[http://www.slideshare.net/BioCatalogue/ismb-2009-demo-introduction|Slide]]

=== Biocuration conference 2009, Berlin, Germany ===
"Biocuration involves the translation and integration of information relevant to biology into a database or resource that enables integration of the scientific literature as well as large data sets. Accurate and comprehensive representation of biological knowledge, as well as easy access to this data for working scientists and a basis for computational analysis, are primary goals of biocuration."
  * Franck Tanoh presented a BioCatalogue [[http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3132/version/1|poster]] at the [[http://projects.eml.org/sdbv/events/BiocurationMeeting/index.html|event]], Berlin, 15-17 October 2009

=== Microsoft e-Science workshop 2008, Indianapolis, US ===
	
**Carole Goble received the inaugural Microsoft Research Jim Gray eScience Award** in recognition of her achievements in the application of computing technology to scientific insight and innovation. The award was presented by Tony Hey, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft External Research.
