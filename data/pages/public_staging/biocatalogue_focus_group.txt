====== BioCatalogue Focus group======
The BioCatalogue focus group is composed of a key set of individuals, who provide guidelines, usage feedback and requirements that may arise from the user community. An area the group is actively focused on is the annotation and curation of web services in the BioCatalogue. 
By choosing these individuals we recognize the value of the community in achieving the goal of the BioCatalogue, a curated catalogue of Life Science Web Service.

**Marco Roos** \\
Marco Roos performs integrative bioinformatics research at the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. He is currently part of the Dutch Virtual Laboratory for e-Science projects and the associated BioRange project. Marco’s main interest is the development of e-Science technology to research the function and structure of DNA in the cell. Apart from requiring detailed computational knowledge, Marco feels that current e-Science technology produces results that are difficult to interpret biologically. In addition, poor documentation makes it difficult to perform reliable and reproducible computer analysis.
