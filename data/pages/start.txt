====== BioCatalogue Home ======
This is the wiki home page of the [[http://www.biocatalogue.org|BioCatalogue]] Project.

BioCatalogue will provide a curated and comprehensive catalogue of biological web services, thereby enabling users (people and programs) to discover and use these services easily. It also aims to provide a platform with several (standardized) interfaces and a suite of tools for registration of services by the community of users as well empower the community to extend and enhance the system. BioCatalogue will provide a centralized biological web services market place which will be accessible to the world as it will be searchable and indexable to search engines. BioCatalogue will provide a
quality of service standard for biological web services thereby enabling services to be classified and checked for availability, reliability and other quality measures.
