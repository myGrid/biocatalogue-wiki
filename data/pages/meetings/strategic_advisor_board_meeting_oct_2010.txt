** Curation & Visibility (community building) **
  * Community building by review process
    * through some journals like NAR
    * through BioCatalogue review process
  * Present the catalogue to journals as providing them a service
    * maybe as part of the submission process
  * Look at research council publishing process. Use their publishing model and see where BioCatalogue fits
  * Investigate partnership with NAR or other journals
  * Make a distinction between the content and infrastructure
  * Promote the BioCatalogue as the central (authoritative) resource rather than just another tool
  * Harness the communities that already exist by providing plugins for existing tools or communities
    * Use environments like galaxy
  * Consider a publication on how to curate. Inform the users on how to curate the services
  * Mind the data in order to discover which points of annotation which are more relevant to users and make those prominent for users for view and annotations
