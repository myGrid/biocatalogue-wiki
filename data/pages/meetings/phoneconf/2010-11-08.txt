===== Actions from Previous Meeting =====   
 
  * Rodrigo/Eric: Send EBI wiki template to Franck
    * There is a custom drupal configuration at EBI that is used for documentation. The idea here was to move from the wiki setup that we have now to a CMS installation that would make the documentation more maintainable & consistently navigable. So there is actually no template to be sent to Franck, however if time permits, we may move the wiki documentation to drupal. But that is a resourcing issue.
  * Rodrigo to handle BioXsD-EDAM contact 
  * Mannie to send the bulk annotation via spreadsheet tool to Hamish for testing
