====== Minutes ======
There is a possible collaboration with Microsoft. Carole, Rodrigo and Rudy will have a meeting in about 2 weeks time. 3 things we should take into account for the collaboration: 
  - can we handle success ... imagine industries submitting 1000s of 1000s of services
  - what are EBI policies on such collaboration? 
  - what help do we need? 

Service Finder has a good interface we can learn from. The main difference between this registry and BioCatalogue should be the quality of our service monitor and the quality of the annotation. Carole insisted on that. 

Service monitor test going well according to Eric

20 questions, Franck to look for patterns in the current 50 questions. Steve pointed out that some of the questions are similar.

Franck is going to the biocuration workshop. He will prepare a poster for that event. 

ISMB: who at the EBI is going? Carole and Katy will go. Carole will skip glastonbury festivals this year in order to go...:-( \\
Franck will submit an abstract for a poster presentation. 

Carole to take some time to prepare the advisory board. she also pointed out that we are out of money for travelling so we should 'travel cheap' whenever possible...no first class ticket, no luxury hotels etc.  

===== New Actions =====

  * Carole/Steve: to look into hiring a summer student for BioCatalogue
  * Franck submit a abstract for poster presentation at ISMB 2009
