====== Minutes ======
 
  * The urgency to release the pilot BioCatalogue was the main issue for discussion. The developers indicated that they were doing all they could to get the pilot released as soon as possible. Unfortunately, there were a few problems with the deployment which they were putting every effort into solving. The expectation was that the pilot will be release before the end of the week for internal use, and and beginning of next week to BioCatalogue friends.
