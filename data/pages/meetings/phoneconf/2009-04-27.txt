====== Minutes ======

   * Testing environment at the EBI
The EBI wants a explicit document of the type of the test we'll harvest, 
   * Service monitoring 
We questioned the use of the traffic light system for the monitor piece only. Pinging a service endpoint and not getting a response back does not necessarily mean that the service is dead (i.e DDBJ). Other criteria such as host name, wsdl availability may also be misleading. We(Eric, Franck, Jits and Thomas) think that the traffic light system should be the result of a careful test (with tests scripts provided by service providers).  
There is therefore a need to find other ways to present(interface wise) the result of a monitored service. Or the traffic light system could be the result of service monitoring + testing\\
The service monitor should include:  1-soap connect, 2-wget, 3-pinging host, 4-pinging endpoing 
   * Merge BioCatalogue - Embrace
The merge will happen when all the features in Embrace are implemented in BioCatalogue. 2 left: testing infrastructure and APIs. 

   * SAB minutes? 
Thomas will send it to the list. 
   * Annotation model document
Franck & Eric are writing it up. 
   * Progress/developement of the pilot
We had good feedback from the friend list. The beta site is no more password protected. \\
Jits has produced a page to gather metric information. 

===== Action Items =====

  * Eric: update the list on issue related to testing and monitoring 
  * Franck: Create a wiki page for testing and monitoring issues.
