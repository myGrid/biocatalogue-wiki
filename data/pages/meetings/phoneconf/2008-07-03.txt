=== Actions Items from Previous Meeting ===

    *  EBI - Register domain name "biocatalogue.org" and contact the Korean institute about "biocatalog.org"  Not  sure if Rodrigo contacted the Korean
    * Eric/Hamish/Thomas - Join the myexperiment skype chats Done
    * Eric/Franck - Produce matrix of service types against bioinformatics domain coverage and properties, to generate a representative set of services to pilot with. Done
    * Everybody - Dump all possible attributes/information that could be collected about services on to the mailing list in order to help Eric/Franck enhance the proposed curation model. Done
    * Jiten/Eric/Thomas - Setup a myExperiment environment at EBI and walk through myExperiment codebase. Done
    * Everyone - Decide the exact date of the next telecom meeting; preferably week starting the 26/05. next meeting on Tuesday 10/06
    * Franck - select representative KEGG services to use. Done
    * Franck - send out definition of "semantic type" to mailing list for further discussion and refinement. Done, definition is in the model
    * Eric/Franck - work on the metatada levels for bronze/silver/gold/platinum compliance. Done, model is on the wiki

=== Round Table ===
  * Franck: worked on the platinum annotation model from which they've derived the bronze, silver and gold.
These models are on the wiki. Selected a number of broadly used bioinformatics web services.
will now describe selected services using the model.

  * Jits: help Thomas and Eric to set up myexperiment code base at EBI. will meet Thomas and Eric to discuss the code base

  * Katy: Attending a Web service metadata meeting in Australia, the report of the meeting is on the list and the wiki.
discuss the annotation model with Franck

  * Eric: worked on the annotation model, Familiarising himself with myExperiment code base. Joined myExperiment 5pm chat.
Will look at the back end database.

  * Thomas: Set up a private myExperiment code base at EBI. Joined myExperiment 5pm chat.

  * Hamish: Encouraging service providers to describe their services.

==== Action Items ====

  * Everybody: read the services matrix and check out the annotations models
  * Franck: post on the list example of stories
  * Thomas: start advertising biocatalogue on the new domain

==== Others ====
  * We all agree to have at this stage weekly meeting. The next one is next Tuesday 3-5pm
  * Everybody should start writing 'stories' about what they do
  * Franck: looking for example of services with security/licensing/restrictions issues to use as example.
