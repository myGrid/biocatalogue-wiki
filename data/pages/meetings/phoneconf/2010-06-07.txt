  * Review of Monitoring: 
-How best can we monitor web service enpoints? The current approach assumes that a service endpoint is fine if it returns a 'xml' or 'html' page when it's pinged.  That doesn't seem to be the case for some services.(e.g. DDBJ). We probably need to tune the monitoring test according to the service. \\
-During the Embrace workshop 2 different ways of monitoring came across: in the first instance, monitor services with a redirect wsdl location, in this case the agreement is that we should automatically pick the new location; in the second instance, when a wsdl changes(e.g functional changes) but the previous version is still working the agreement is that we should keep both copies but point to the latest. 

  * Review of curation: 
-Franck is clearing up the registry and archiving deprecated services. \\
-Jits has started to work on the curation dashboard. Currently curators can identify which operation within a service are similar based on their name. Annotation can be copied across from operation to operation. \\

  * Report from the Embrace service provider meeting: 
-The general feedback is that the BioCatalogue is a good product and very useful too. \\
-Need to support semantic annotation using EDAM for example; Jon is writing down how this can be achieved.\\ 
-Need to support SAWSDL and BioSXD. There is growing number of services providers supporting BioXSD \\
-Find better rating of the service. A metric for service provider to see how their service is being used. \\
-Possibility to view more services per page (at the moment too much scrolling when using a laptop. \\
-Reduce white space\\
-Atom feed with category for service providers
