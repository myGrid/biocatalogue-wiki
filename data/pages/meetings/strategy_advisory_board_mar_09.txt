===== 1. Welcome and introductions =====

The SAB and the BioCatalogue delivery team were introduced. The SAB were invited to suggest other members. A suggestion was made that Rudy Potenzone (Microsoft, [[http://bioitalliance.org|BioIT Alliance]]) join the SAB.

===== 2. Presentation of the BioCatalogue project =====

{{:meetings:sab_-_biocatalogue.ppt|BioCatalogue presentation}}

The SAB approved of the progress that the BioCatalogue team had made, particularly in such a short time. The SAB were also pleased to note that the team were working well, and that the [[http://www.embracegrid.info|EMBRACE]] link had been so successfully forged.

===== 3. Presentation of the Seekda project =====

{{:meetings:sab_-_2009-03-20-holger.pdf|Seekda presentation}}

[[http://seekda.com|Seekda]] have been excellent collaborators with BioCatalogue and have opened up their interfaces in order to channel content. Holger had to leave the meeting early but reaffirmed his support.

===== 4. Demonstration of the BioCatalogue private release =====

[[http://beta.biocatalogue.org|BioCatalogue private release]]

The release was presented by the development team and discussed. The [[http://www.embraceregistry.net|EMBRACE registry]] demonstration was considered unnecessary as we were pressed for time and features had been presented in the BioCatalogue presentation.

===== 5. Discussion =====
The following points arose in a wide-ranging and positive discussion.

==== I. BBSRC evaluation  and long term recognition of BioCatalogue ====

Criteria on which the [[http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/|BBSRC]] will evaluate the success of the project were identified. Carole made the point that these criteria will need to be reported annually and are the foundation of future funding:  
  * Number of people using it
  * Level of content
  * Importance in the community
  * Coverage of the field

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Review the project against criteria for success at each SAB meeting (All)
  * Ensure that the metrics are gathered (BioCatalogue team)
</box>

==== II. Review of Features and Functionalities ====

=== a. Searching ===

  * Search terms should be matched to **ontologies** to allow for richer searches, perhaps using the [[http://bioontology.org|NCBO]] ontology services
  * **Thesaurus** based search term expansion and presentation of results
  * The BioCatalogue team should investigate [[http://cohse.cs.manchester.ac.uk/|COHSE]] to get broader terms and narrower terms
  * BioCatalogue should be searchable by [[http://www.google.com|Google]] and the [[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/|EBI search engine]]
  * BioCatalogue should use standard tools for search expansion
  * The BioCatalogue team should investigate the **clustering** engine [[http://project.carrot2.org/|carrot2]] to enhance the search results returned by [[http://lucene.apache.org/solr/|SOLR]]

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Identify mechanisms for using ontologies for search (BioCatalogue team)
  * Identify mechanisms for using search engines (BioCatalogue team)
</box>

=== b. Browsing ===
 
  * **Facetted browsing:** we need classification of services based on domains e.g. proteomic, genomic, metabolomic...    
  * **Sourcing from ontology:** [[http://www.mygrid.org.uk/tools/service-management/mygrid-ontology/|myGrid ontology]] may not be enough to annotate all services. We need to source from other ontologies as well

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Develop a classification of services for facets (All)
  * Develop a general ontology annotation tool (BioCatalogue team)
</box>

=== c. Web Service Registration ===

  * **Terms & Conditions:** when registering a service the user/provider needs to agree with the T&C (need advice on that matter, maybe from Manchester Business School)
  * **Service ownership:**
    * we should also ask if the submitter is the provider/owner of the service
    * we need to think about the process of the transfer of ownership
    * if owner, we should give a choice of notifications at registration time (when service fails its tests...)
  * **Notifications:** feedback loop to users and service providers need to be more explicit

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Revise the registration (BioCatalogue team)
  * Seek advice from Manchester Business School on the issue of terms & conditions when registering a service (Carole)
  * Discuss with DDBJ, NCBI issues of ownership and diplomacy wrt registration (Rodrigo) 
</box>

=== d. Annotations ===
 
  * **Ontologies:** possibility to use additional ontologies
  * **Metadata:** need to make it clear to the providers what is the benefit from providing more metadata (better visibility...) 
  * We need to make sure we don’t mislead people about services having a lot of metadata but with a bad quality service

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Review the role of metadata and how this is presented to users and providers (All)
</box>

=== e. Quality of service / Metrics ===
This topic attracted a great deal of discussion. It is important to report accurate a meaningful measures that can be defended.
  * we need to **separate the measurements**:
    * subjective vs objective
    * machine vs human
  * We should be careful with subjective ratings not to offend providers 
  * **Speed** of a service is difficult to measure and very subjective
  * **Feedback** to providers is an important aspect of the monitoring piece
  * Additional valuable feedback we should allow users to provide:
    * "Did the service do what I want it to do?"
    * "Did the service do what it said it would do?"
  * We could display how many times a Web Service has been seen/visited
  * We could check how e-commerce websites handle ranking (in literature, with business school...)

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Review the role of QoS and operational metrics taking into account accuracy and sensitivities but without giving up the possibility to rank and discriminate (All)
</box>

=== f. Social networking ===
  * We need to be careful not to appear to support any comment post to the BioCatalogue (write **disclaimer**)
  * Provide service providers clear paths and opportunities to **respond** to negative comments
  * Should we consider using **multiple discussion threads** (using [[http://disqus.com/|DISQUS]]) to be able to separate general comments from technical issues with a Web Service ?
  * We probably shouldn’t allow **anonymous** comments
  * We should provide a "did you find this comment useful" functionality
  * We should also provide a "did you find the Web Service you were looking for" functionality for both anonymous and registered users

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Produce disclaimer words (BioCatalogue team)
  * Incorporate social network suggestions by the SAB into the release (BioCatalogue team)
</box>

=== g. Testing / Monitoring ===
  * **Test scripts:** they are very valuable as they also serve as example of how to run the service
  * **Feedback:** tests are a valuable information for users but also an important feedback for service providers as it allows them to test that their service is working and reachable by the outside world. We should emphasize this point to providers to encourage them to submit test scripts
  * Care must be taken that the testing and monitoring is safe when alien scripts are provided
  * We should produce a policy for marking depreciated and regularly failing services  

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Devise policy for repeatedly failing services (All)
</box>
 

===== 6. Launch strategy =====

  * [[http://www.biocurator.org|BioCuration]]/[[http://bioitalliance.org/|BioIT]] - silent launch (open up the [[http://beta.biocatalogue.org|beta site]])
  * [[http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2009/|ISMB/ECCB]] in July, is the real launch target. A poster has already been submitted and a demo will be submitted as well (Taverna integration will be ready by then)
  * We could investigate using Google ads but it is very VERY expensive
  * We need to find out what are the mailing lists we should advertise the launch on
  * Press releases: talk to journals/publishers about BioCatalogue
  * BBSRC Newsletter 
  * Students and teaching – Anil’s help
  * EU networks
  * Sponsorship of activities

<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Submit an ISMB demo abstract by 20th April (Franck)
  * Present talk at the BioITWorld meeting April 28th  (Carole)
  * Identify mailing lists (All)
  * Produce press releases (Rodrigo, Carole)
  * Promote BioCatalogue through teaching (Anil Wipat)
  * Produce materials and flyers for promotion at all events (Franck)
</box>

===== 7. BioIT Alliance =====

Carole presented the [[http://bioitalliance.org|BioIT Alliance]], which has requested an alliance with BioCatalogue as part of their activities. It is a vendor alliance lead by Rudy Potenzone of Microsoft. The benefits would be a widening of content to vendors, increased visibility and a publicity forum. It is also a possible path to sustainability. The SAB approved of the alliance and noted that Carole would present the BioCatalogue at the BioIT Alliance lunch at [[http://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/|BioITWorld]], Boston, April 28th 2009.

===== 8. Term of reference SAB =====

  * A quarterly report should be send to the SAB team
  * Meeting once a year
  * Create a SAB mailing list for contact
                                    
<box 100% left round green|Actions to be taken>
  * Create a mailing list for the SAB team (Jits)
  * Produce quarterly report (Carole/Rodrigo)
  * Meeting between the BioCatalogue team and the Seekda Service Finder team (Holger, BioCatalogue Team)
