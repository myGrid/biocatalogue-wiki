==== Review of the current BioCatalogue ====
 
=== Developer report ===
  * Release of REST API
  * API development was driven by Onyx portal and Taverna-BioCatalogue plug-in
  * API mainly XML output, some have JSON (all endpoints do not have JSON outputs due to time)
  * REST support work, and service monitoring 
  * Moving to a cycle of fortnightly releases
  * Search engine updated to show services and SOAP operations where available

**Actions:**
  * Eric: Need to monitor the service monitor

**Suggestion:** 
  * Carole: WSDL and WADL parsers can be packaged as different product

=== User and curation report ===

  * Curation stats not very good, only 30% curated 
  * We need to solve the problem of how to understand service. We have solved partially how to find it. 
  * Serious need to address content
  * Get the community involved; e.g. use EBI cloud to contract providers and projects .
  * Find out how many service providers BioCatalogue actually has. 
  * Check the possibility to automate brute force poking to check for example data for inputs/outputs for soap operations 
  * Cluster services based on annotation quality and contact providers directly
  * Clone annotation of same services 
  * Better curation tools: Curation workbench and bulk curation toolkit

**Actions:** 
  * Franck: finish the provider chart 
  * Eric/Jits/Franck: Get data from myExperiment
  * Eric/Jits: Only show preferred description

=== Collaborating projects ===

  * **Embrace registry** :For a complete handover of the Embrace registry we need the write API. Need also to make sure the test script monitoring works fine
  * **NCRI**: Currently using the BioCatalogue API
  * **Taverna**: Alpha version of the Taverna-BioCatalogue plug-in exists. Improvements due in the summer. 
  * **GenePattern**: Interested in the functional unit implementation
  * **myExperiment**: More integration BioCatalogue-myExperiment is currently ongoing 
  * **BioMoby/SADI**: David Withers to work on the SPARQL endpoint for BioCatalogue

=== Project planning ===

More emphasis on curation and curation tools 

=== Outreach ===
 
  * Embrace meeting in Denmark 
  * ISMB 2010
  * ECCB 2010

=== More Actions ===
 
  * Jits: Service status changes email to developers 
  * Jits/Mannie: Service update checker (WSDL checker)
  * Eric: remove orphaned service providers
  * Eric: Fix ‘localhost’ provider
  * Franck: Roster of people to contact for service providers and the material required to do that. 
  * Jits/Mannie: Write API and Mass curation tool via spreadsheets
