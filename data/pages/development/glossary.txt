==== Web Service ====
Set of functionality that is intended for programmatic access via web technologies.

=== Operation ===
Operation relates to units of functionality within the Web Service.

=== Service Base ===
In the context of REST Web Services, the longest common shared URI.

=== Service Endpoint ===
URI associated with a particular operation of a Web Service. 

=== REST ===
REST in the context of Web Services is a method of defining the service in a particular way using a type of distributed architecture based on resources.

== Resource ==
  * In the context of REST. A primitive in the Web Architecture, and is used in the definition of its elements.
  * A resource is an abstraction of a specific piece of application state or functionality.
  * An end-point of the URI.
  * For the purpose of Web Services, actions on Resources are analogous to Operations.

=== SOAP ===
A protocol for exchanging XML-based messages over computer networks, normally using HTTP/HTTPS. SOAP forms the foundation layer of the web services protocol stack providing a basic messaging framework upon which abstract layers can be built.

There are two main types of SOAP Web Service encodings:
  * RPC Encoded
  * Document Literal

== RPC Encoded ==
A style of SOAP Web Service; a particular way of constructing the content of XML messages, based on not having a schema (unlike in Document Literal, where they are).

== Document Literal ==
A style of SOAP Web Service; the structure of the content of the XML messages is defined by an XML schema.

=== WSDL ===
Web Services Description Language, a standard format for describing the interface of SOAP-based Web Services and a certain class of REST Web Services.

==== Annotation ====
Annotation is a **specific** piece of metadata associated with a **specific** aspect of the Web Service. Annotations may have a type and a context.

=== Semantic Annotation ===
Semantic Annotation is a **specific** piece of metadata associated with a **specific** aspect of the Web Service. These Annotations are terms from a specific ontology or a controlled vocabulary. They also must have a type and context.

=== Curation ===
The act of moderating metadata and annotations often resulting in assertions that either add or agree/dispute existing annotations.
