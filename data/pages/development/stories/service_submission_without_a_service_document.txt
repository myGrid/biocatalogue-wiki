====== Service Submission without a Service Document ======

Service providers want to be able to submit their service to the catalogue. Many REST services and some SOAP services do not expose a service document, so the appropriate information will have to be suppiled manually. For these services we require a service name, service description, service location (documentation or endpoint URL).
