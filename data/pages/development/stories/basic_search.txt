====== Basic Search ======

Search by a casual user is in the Google style using a simple set of search terms possibly with simple modifers. By default it is expected that the search terms are case insensitive and combined with AND. Results are a list of matching items with either brief descriptions or matched terms in context.

//(Which fields should be returned ? If only brief descriptions, do we want the information "Match found in <field_name_1> and <field_name_2>" ?)//

==== APIs ====
