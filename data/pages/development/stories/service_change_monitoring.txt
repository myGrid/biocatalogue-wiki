====== Service Change Monitoring ======

Notification of service changes is a requirement of many users. Unlike [[Search Result Alerting]] this is related solely to a changes to specific service. This ties into service versioning. Notification of changes can be via either e-mail or news feed depending on user requirements.

This may also be a requirement for some desktop applications which integrate a particular service, as part of being able to notify the user of potential problems.
