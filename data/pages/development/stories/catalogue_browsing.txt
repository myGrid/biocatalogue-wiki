====== Catalogue Browsing ======

For some user searches and for a variety of administration and testing tasks it is useful to be able to browse the catalogue in a number of ways:
  - Index, possibly with filtering term searches:
    - service names
    - user tags
    - descriptive ontology terms
    - type of service (SOAP, REST, DAS...)
    - Resource used 
    - Result produced 
  - Directory:
    - taxonomy of services
    - by organisation
    - by country
    - type of service (SOAP, REST, DAS...)
    - by ratings ?
    - by QoS ?
