Test Harness Machine (ves-hx-2c ):

    Machine Name : ves-hx-2c
    Operating System : Fedora 14
    Users : root & biocat

This machine runs the biocatalogue test harness. The harness is located under two directories : development and production running against the test and live sites respectively. The corresponding directories are shown below with the directory structure shown for production only since they are identical:

    /home/biocat/projects/biocatalogue/harness/development
    /home/biocat/projects/biocatalogue/harness/production

                        /archive

                        /config

                        /crons

                        /log

                        /servicetests

                        /src                    

    archive
        This is used to archive the logs of the harness so that the individual job log directories can be clean up
        A cron job does the archiving of the logs
    config
        This contains the configuration files for running the harness. There are two main configuration files. An xml file to that lists the jobs to run and .config file that controls the general behavior of the harness
    crons
        Contains some shell scripts which are run as crons jobs
        Also contains a file to use for generating a crontable
    log
        Directory to store harness logs
    servicetests
        Directory keep the individual job scripts. They are launched from here
    src
        The source directory of the harness scripts. These are written in python
         

To run the harness, a cron table is setup with the configuration of the crons available in crons/crontable under the harness directories. To install a new cron, simply modify this file and run the command

    crontab <path to crontable file>
