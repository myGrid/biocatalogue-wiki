Dear all,

We updated the BioCatalogue on Friday 21 November 2009 with the following:
 - Allow submitters or curators to set alternative names as the preferred display name of a service (so that you can show more descriptive names for service)
 - User experience improvements for the submission of Soaplab servers. 
 - Using the classification of the soaplab tools(determined from the wsdl file names) to set the preferred names automatically
