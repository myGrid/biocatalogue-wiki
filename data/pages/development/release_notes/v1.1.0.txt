==== v1.1.0 Release (Sep 2011) ====

This will be a major release with some new features and major improvements.

This will include:
  * New "examples" tab for services. Surfaces all existing example data and scripts for a service, and provides simple abilities to add examples.
  * Richer annotation values support. This will improve semantic annotation capabilities and improve performance in certain areas (like generating tag filters in the Taverna plugin).
  * Support for custom monitoring of REST services - maintainer of the service can provide a custom URL to monitor (which can include secret info like an API key).
  * (possibly) Secure web pages - site will run with SSL turned on for all pages.
  * Users can now see the list of people who have been granted responsibility for a service.
  * Some UI and performance tweaks.

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> this releases includes a major change in the way annotations work and thus requires a big data migration of all the Annotations data. When running "rake db:migrate" this could take over 3 hours to complete, and it's important to check the output of this to make sure everything ran OK.

=== Update instructions (for local and Manchester servers): ===

**NOTE:** when running in production environments make sure to set/add ''RAILS_ENV=production'' to any ruby/rake commands below.

Run:

  svn update
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:test:prepare RAILS_ENV=test
  ruby script/biocatalogue/migrate_display_names_jul11.rb
    Expected output (something like):
    > 1184 display names moved to the parent Service
    > 0 display_name annotations remaining in the db
  ruby script/biocatalogue/fix_url_monitors_using_annotations_sep11.rb
    Expected output (something like):
    > 43 URL monitors updated

You **may** need to reindex your search index if you experience problems - ''rake solr solr:reindex'', but note that it will take a long time to run.

Additionally, for production environments:

  rake asset:packager:build_all RAILS_ENV=production

To restart an app deployed under apache and phusion passenger:

  touch tmp/restart.txt

=== Update instructions (for EBI servers): ===

First, follow instructions here:
http://www.biocatalogue.org/docs/installing-new-release

**Note**: it's **CRUCIAL** that the full output of the update script is viewed to ensure the migration went ahead smoothly.

Then run the following (in the directory where the code is deployed):

  ruby script/biocatalogue/migrate_display_names_jul11.rb
  ruby script/biocatalogue/fix_url_monitors_using_annotations_sep11.rb
  rake asset:packager:build_all RAILS_ENV=production
  touch tmp/restart.txt

  rake test:units RAILS_ENV=test
  rake test:functionals RAILS_ENV=test
  rake test:integration RAILS_ENV=test
