  Hi all
  
  We have just released a brand new "Search by data" feature. It allows
  you to query for services that might analyze or process a given real
  data. For example, given a Fasta file, it returns a list of services
  that possibly consume sequences in Fasta format.
  
  To access the feature go to:
  www.biocatalogue.org/search/by_data
  or click on a drop-down button just on the right site of "Providers" link.
  
  We would appreciate any suggestions or comments which will help us to
  improve this feature.
  Note that "Search by data" depends on example inputs and outputs for
  service operations in BioCatalogue.
  If you add a new service or annotate one, please add example inputs and
  outputs to improve the visibility of the service.
  
  Note also that we are logging your queries, which enables us to monitor
  and improve the quality on results. We hope to use this data to develop
  automatic tools for service annotation in the future. Meanwhile, we
  suggest you not to use secure or confidential data while searching for
  services.
  
  Regards,
  
  The BioCatalogue Team
