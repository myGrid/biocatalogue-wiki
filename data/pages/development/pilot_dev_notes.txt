===== Codebase Guidelines =====

See: [[development:codebase_guidelines]]

===== Disqus Integration =====

The commenting/discussing facility uses the Disqus system (http://disqus.com/).

The admin/moderator/profile interface can be accessed on the Disqus website using:
  Username: biocatalogue
  Password: biocateatdogs
  Email: jits@cs.man.ac.uk

For the actual comments/discussions data, two separate website accounts have been set up:

  - Test/dev account to be used for testing purposes only
    * Account name: biocatalogue-test
    * Community page: http://biocatalogue-test.disqus.com/
  - Main account to be used for the main website only
    * Account name: biocatalogue
    * Community page: http://biocatalogue.disqus.com/

\\
**PLEASE NOTE:** 
Make sure you copy the relevant settings from the local config template...
  /app/config/initializers/biocat_local.rb.pre
... to your local config file...
  /app/config/initializers/biocat_local.rb
It is crucial that the correct account name is configured here: 
  * For the beta/main site it should be "biocatalogue"
  * For local development/testing it should be "biocatalogue-test".
