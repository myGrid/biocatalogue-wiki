Web Service in the catalogue will be ranked base on their annotation quality:
====== 1-Plantinum annotation ======
We're aiming to get every single service in the catalogue annotated at the platinum level. The platinum annotation contains anything one can think of to describe a given service. The model used: {{:development:software_development:annotation_model_platinum.pdf|}}
====== 2-Gold annotation ======
These annotations are very close to the platinum one but awaiting expert curators approval stamp to get them to the platinum level. The annotation is based on the gold annotation model:
{{:development:software_development:gold_annotation_model.pdf|}}

====== 3-Silver annotation ======
Here quality information of the service maybe missing in the annotation. Also need to be stamped by expert curators. 
The model used is the {{:development:software_development:silver_annotation_model.pdf|}}
====== 4-Bronze annotation ======
Contains basic information of the service such as name, location, provider and documentation location.
