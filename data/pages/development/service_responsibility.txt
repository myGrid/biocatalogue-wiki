==== Taking Responsibility for a Service ====

=== Motivation ===

BioCatalogue is community driven, thereby allowing any registered member to submit data to the catalogue including services that may not be developed, maintained or owned by them. By default, management privileges for such services are given to the member(called the submitter) that submitted the service. However, often the owner, maintainer, developers or anyone responsible for the service in some way would want to have these management privileges as well in order to keep the service entry in BioCatalogue up to date.

=== Requirements === 
  - Any logged in member should be able to make a request to take responsibility for a service
  - When a request is made, the BioCatalogue administrators and the currently responsible persons for that service should be informed (via mail)
  - The default responsible persons (with full privileges) are the submitter and the BioCatalogue administrators
  - Any of the responsible persons for a service can approve/turn down a responsibility request
  - Those that are already responsible for a service should not be able to submit responsibility request for that service
  - When a responsibility request is approved, the requesting user gets full privileges on the service

=== Constraints ===

  - A user(member) can have only one pending responsibility request per service at any time
  - Only registered and logged in members can submit requests


=== Some comments by Franck ===
There are some issues to consider: 
  * When a request is made do we wait for the OK from the submitter or do any of the responsible persons just change it? 
  * what if the Submitter refuses? We need a procedure in place. 
  * Also need to inform the previous submitter when the process is completed
