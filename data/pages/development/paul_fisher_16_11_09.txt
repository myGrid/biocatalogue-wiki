====== Paul Fisher's feedback ======
  * Easy way to access my services or my stuff
  * What to do if i don't want everybody to see my services
  * The country flag should mention that it's the location of the service as some users might think that it's the location of the submitter 
  * The search within result would be nice if it's applicable to search result too not only filtering result 
  * It is not clear from the operation page where are the input and output of the services. It all over the place. Need a way to allow the user to see just the basic something like [[http://rpc274.cs.man.ac.uk:8080/ondex/parser.html#kegg2Parser|here]]
  * Possibility to collapse example input/output if there are too many
  * Description box can be replaced by add description 
  * Possibility to test services 
  * Replace the term 'overview' by another word maybe 'Detail service view'
  * Monitor picture is the most important but lost in the middle of load of texts. 
  * Comment system is not too flexible. 
  * Make soaplab submission easy 
  * During submission if a service is already submitted should be able to see his overview without clicking on that service
