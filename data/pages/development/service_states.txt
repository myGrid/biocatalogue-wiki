=== Service Life Cycle States ===

Web Service go through an existence life cycle with different states which need to be reflected in BioCatalogue. These states may include:
  * development
  * production
  * deprecated
  * discontinued
  * dead

To allow BioCatalogue to handle these states, the following requirements will need to be met:

  - A service in BioCatalogue will be in one and only one state at a time
  - A user with the correct permissions will be able to change the state of a service
  - The state of the service will be displayed as a badge
  - The 'state badge' will be clickable and will return all services in that state
  - When a change state of a service occurs, information about the user that made the change should be recorded
  - A notification may be sent out to designated people when a change of state occurs
