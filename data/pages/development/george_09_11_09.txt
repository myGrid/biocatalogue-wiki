====== George's feedback ======

===== Search =====
  * want to be able to sort search result e.g. by service history
  * provider to be notified when a service is down
  * for the search result want to see the number of member who annotated a given service
  * the 'Switch to Detail view' can move up from it current place. This will reduce white space
  
===== Browsing =====
  * Members should be able to view their own tag cloud.
  * Personalise tag cloud. Be able to view what is interesting for you
  * Translate the combination of filters into search query e.g. Filtering by service type(REST) and service category (Text mining) should automatically write in the search from: [REST] AND [Text mining]




===== Annotation =====
  * Find the annotation box annoying specially when there are no annotation
  * If you click in an annotation box and don't supply any annotation the box just stays
