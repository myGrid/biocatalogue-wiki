====== Curation roadmap ======

Content curation is key to the BioCatalogue. Thatâ€™s why the BioCatalogue team is working hard to improve the quality and the quantity of annotations in the BioCatalogue. The team will address both technical and social aspects of curation.  
  * The technical aspect should allow users to find the services to annotate and the tool to use. It should also allow the BioCatalogue to automatically import annotations from different sources. 
  * The social aspect aims to encourage members of the BioCatalogue to annotate services. 

===== Technical aspect =====
 
  * **UI improvement:** Improve the way service operations are displayed in the BioCatalogue  [//**January-March 2010**//]
  * **Bulk curation tools:** spreadsheet like tools  [//**January-March 2010**//]
  * **Curator reports:** to keep curators up to date of the content
  * **Annotation status:** has all parts of the service been annotated? How many of them have been annotated? revisit bronze-silver-gold-platinum model.
  * **Write APIs:** possibility to import annotation through the BioCatalogue APIs
  * **Service ranking and filtering based on annotation**
  * **Screen scraping:** bespoke scripts to extract service description from web sites
  * **Who is who?** Curator vs casual annotator. Curators will have a stamp next to their name in the catalogue. 
  * **Service versioning:** same services or similar services will be grouped together. If one is annotated we can derive the annotation of the others. 

===== Social aspect =====
 
  * **Outreach:** presentation, training and demo of the BioCatalogue
  * **White paper:** annotation guidelines 
  * **Jamboree:** organise a number of annotation jamborees
