====== Soaplab service in BioCatalogue ======

=== What is Soaplab? ===   
  * Soaplab is a specialised Web Services software framework for command-line bioinformatics programs. It includes a  library for running command-line programs and provides support to generate Java Web Services web applications based on this library. An important part of the library is a container that manages life cycle of the jobs effectively. Soaplab generic interface[1] makes it possible to use the same interface for all programs deployed. Soaplab is well known to many bioinformaticians since it has built-in support for EMBOSS programs and also because the European Bioinformatics Institute where Soaplab was developed has had an active Soaplab server since year 2003. It can be said that initial development of Soaplab was supported by the UK e-Science program, and it was part of the myGrid project [source: wikipedia].
