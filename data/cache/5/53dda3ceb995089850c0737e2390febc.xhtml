This is the BioCatalogue <acronym title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</acronym> … to start, I&#039;ll list the questions then assign them to members of the team —
</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Why BioCatalogue?</strong></div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
While biologist and Bioinformatician find the use of web services critical for their work, they also encounter a number of difficulties associated with the current state of many services and the access to these services. These problems include:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> lack of a centralised resources that comprehensively catalogues life science web services thereby making these web services hard to find</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the poor documentation or the lack of documentation for many existing web services thereby making them hard to use</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> lack of effort to improve the quality and coverage of the documentation of these services which means that the documentation if it exist is often out of sync with the current state of the service</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> lack of information on the quality of services like their availability and reliability</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The BioCatalogue is aiming to solve the above-mentioned issues by providing a curated and comprehensive catalogue of biological web services.
BioCatalogue will provide a quality of service standard for biological web services thereby enabling services to be classified and checked for availability, reliability and other quality measures. It also aims to provide a platform with several (standardized) interfaces and a suite of tools for registration of services by the community of users as well as empower the community to extend and enhance the system.
