<div class="level1">

<p>
<strong>Curators</strong> are after all only <strong>human beings</strong> (sorry to break it to you like that Franck !). And like all human beings they have <strong>weaknesses</strong> we can try to exploit to make them participate to the curation effort:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>lust</strong>: this one has a lot of potential but could lead us in <strong>jail</strong>, so maybe not such a good idea…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>greed</strong>: “a free <strong>ipod</strong> for any new annotation !”. That&#039;s bound to be a winner ! On the other hand, I&#039;m kind of concerned about our <strong>budget</strong>…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>gluttony</strong>: I&#039;d do anything for a <strong>cake</strong> and I guess a few curators would too, but again, <strong>budget</strong> might be an issue…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>sloth</strong>: this one is kind of the <strong>opposite</strong> of want we want to do, so let&#039;s skip it…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>wrath</strong>: from all the sins, this one is the most <strong>pointless</strong>, so I don&#039;t even want to waste more words on it…</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>envy/pride</strong>: here we go, this one(s) is the most <strong>widespread</strong> in the scientific community. That&#039;s probably our <strong>best angle of attack</strong>.</div>
</li>
</ul>

2 of the biggest names on internet relies heavily on added contents by their users: <strong>amazon</strong> and <strong>ebay</strong>.
Amazon is providing invaluable additional information about products through their user <strong>reviews</strong>, and ebay has based his <strong>“trusting” mechanism</strong> on the biggest part on users providing feedback on sellers/buyers. Ebay is also rating reviewers for the “ebay reviews” section.<br/>

</p>

<p>
<a href="/wiki/_media/development:amazon_badges.gif" class="media mediafile mf_gif" title="development:amazon_badges.gif (1.1 KB)">Amazon badges</a> <a href="/wiki/_media/development:ebay_badges.gif" class="media mediafile mf_gif" title="development:ebay_badges.gif (12.9 KB)">Ebay badges</a><br/>

</p>

<p>
Both websites ranks reviewers according to the <strong>helpfulness of their reviews</strong> rather there on the sheer amount they produced.
</p>

<p>
I think if it&#039;s good enough for these 2 heavyweights of internet, it&#039;s probably <strong>good enough</strong> for the BioCatalogue. People like to be recognised as being a <strong>“Top something”</strong>, it flatters their ego.
My <strong>concern</strong> would be on the ranking of reviewers: do we adopt the same system than amazon/ebay, and rank on the <strong>relevance</strong> of the extra information ? Or on the <strong>volume</strong> produced by an annotator ?
</p>

<p>
I see caveats in both schemes:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> rank on <strong>quality</strong>: </div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> we rely on <strong>other people</strong> to rank the annotation (hence the annotator), so we need a certain <strong>volume of users</strong> so that the number of votes has any <strong>“statistical relevance”</strong> (not a pb for amazon/ebay).</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> we need to provide a “did you find this annotation useful” functionality (buttons) for every single annotation. That seems overkill and will heavily <strong>clutter</strong> the UI. Or do we only provide this functionality on <strong>description fields</strong> (for web service, operations, inputs, outputs) ? It&#039;d make it more manageable. But then, what about the curator who had loads of valuable informations which are not descriptions ? It&#039;s a bit <strong>unfair</strong>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> rank on <strong>quantity</strong>:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> would be easier to put in place as <strong>we already keep the provenance of all annotations</strong>. But what about if a curator puts 100&#039;s of rubbish annotations ? He&#039;ll end with a “Top XX curator” badge while he <strong>wouldn&#039;t deserve one</strong>. Can this scenario happen ? I don&#039;t think it&#039;s very likely, people don&#039;t want to be playing with their reputation just for a badge, they know it could make them more harm than good in the long term. One solution could be: “if you want to be eligible for a badge, you have to provide your real name” and we&#039;d tag them as well like amazon does with a <strong>“real name” badge</strong>, which makes people want to trust this source more than a semi-anonymous one. But I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s a good idea and once again probably overkill.</div>

<div class="level3">

<p>
Providers have been very reactive to the green/amber light on the current site.
We have for example seen people emailing us to update their services or ask what wrong with their services. 
So we should use the same idea for annotation, that is, have a kind of annotation meter on the overview page. 
The meter will display the percentage of the current annotation of the service.

<div class="level2">

<p>
After weighting all these different options, here are my views:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Having an “ubber-trustworthy” badge (like amazon&#039;s “Amazon Official” abdge): <strong>“BioCatalogue certified curator”</strong> that we manually assign to a select number of people (starting with Franck)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Having several <strong>“Top XX curator”</strong> badges: like amazon/ebay BUT based on <strong>volume</strong> of annotations produced. Basing it on quality seems too complicated and overkill for the BioCatalogue.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The meter will be use as a quantitative measurement of service annotation. </div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For quality of annotation we could use the biocatalogue curation badge as defined by Thomas.
</p>

<p>
After discussion with the group we&#039;re going to have a 2 way meter. So the meter will give a level of annotation of absolutely necessary metadata and the level of other metadata about the service. 
in order to do that we need to define the &#039;absolutely necessary metadata&#039;. 
</p>

<p>
This should be enough to get provide a small incentive and appeal to the users ego to <strong>get involved</strong> in the BioCatalogue curation.
