BioCatalogue is community driven, thereby allowing any registered member to submit data to the catalogue including services that may not be developed, maintained or owned by them. By default, management privileges for such services are given to the member(called the submitter) that submitted the service. However, often the owner, maintainer, developers or anyone responsible for the service in some way would want to have these management privileges as well in order to keep the service entry in BioCatalogue up to date.

<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> When a request is made do we wait for the OK from the submitter or do any of the responsible persons just change it? </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> what if the Submitter refuses? We need a procedure in place. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Also need to inform the previous submitter when the process is completed </div>

</ul>
