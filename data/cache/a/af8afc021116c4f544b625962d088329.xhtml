<p>

Service providers want to be able to submit their service to the catalogue. Many REST services and some <acronym title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP</acronym> services do not expose a service document, so the appropriate information will have to be suppiled manually. For these services we require a service name, service description, service location (documentation or endpoint <acronym title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym>).
