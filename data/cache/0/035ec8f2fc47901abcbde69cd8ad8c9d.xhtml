<p>
Web Service annotation can be defined as specific piece of metadata(text, image etc…) associated with a specific aspect of the Web Service. The annotations may be context specific and can be designed for human or for machine.<br/>

The point of the annotation is to describe services and their components (operation, resources, inputs, outputs etc.) so that users or programs can find and use them.
