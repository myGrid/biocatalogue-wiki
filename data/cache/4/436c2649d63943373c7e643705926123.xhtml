<div class="level2">

<p>
Web Service is a resource that can be programatically accessed over the Internet. The difference between Web Services and Web Servers is that Web Servers concentrate on user interface which is displayed in a browser and accessible to humans, whereas Web Services concentrate on execution by programs or scripts. 
</p>

<p>
This does not mean that Web Services cannot be executed by humans. Contrary, there are many tools that automatically generate graphical interfaces for Web Services, which saves time spent on building the interface by service providers.
