<p>

Many developers and systematic users have a requirement for notification if the results of a search change. One basic scenario is the bioinformatican who is using a particular service for a particular piece of functionality (e.g. BLAST), but who has had to workaround a flaw or limitation in the service to be able to get their required result. Thus they have an interest in being informed if an alternative service becomes available that better suits their requirements. The alert could be either via e-mail or via an search based news feed, depending on the user&#039;s requirements.
