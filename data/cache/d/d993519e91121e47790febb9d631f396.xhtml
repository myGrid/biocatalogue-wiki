<p>
Web Service annotation can be defined as specific piece of metadata(text, image etc…) associated with a specific aspect of the Web Service. The annotations may be context specific and can be designed for human or for machine.<br/>

The point of the annotation is to describe services and their components (operation, resources, inputs, outputs etc.) so that users or programs can find and use them.

<p>
The first thing to consider when you are annotating a service is to point to its documentation. 
In the BioCatalogue you can use one or several URLs to point to the service documentation.

<h3 class="sectionedit5" id="what_is_it_about">2-What is it about?</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Define the purpose of the service. Clearly describe what the service does by giving clear and simple details of what the service is meant to do. 
In the BioCatalogue use the description field provided. Add tags to the service.

<p>
People will use a service if they find it useful. Are there any restrictions such as licenses, usage restriction applied to the service? Highlight them. 
In the BioCatalogue use the required fields such as license, cost, usage restriction to highlight them.
