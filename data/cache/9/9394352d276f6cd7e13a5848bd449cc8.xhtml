Some users may be monitoring many services at both <a href="/wiki/development:stories:search_result_alerting" class="wikilink1" title="development:stories:search_result_alerting">Search Result Alerting</a> and <a href="/wiki/development:stories:service_change_monitoring" class="wikilink1" title="development:stories:service_change_monitoring">Service Change Monitoring</a> and would prefer to be able to monitor a single feed. Building in aggregation features will make it simple to create a collection of monitors and alerts (possibly customised for specific requirements) which can be handled as a single “My BioCatalogue Alerts” feed.
