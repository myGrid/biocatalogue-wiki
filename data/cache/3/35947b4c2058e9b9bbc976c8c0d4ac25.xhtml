<p>
The BioCatalogue Mass Curator application is a small tool which utilizes BioCatalogue&#039;s read/write <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym> to handle batch annotation of web services via the use of spreadsheets
</p>

<p>
BioCatalogue curators can use the tool to browse and/or search the catalogue for web services and select services they are interested in annotating.  The selected collection of services can then be exported into an annotation template (in the form of an Excel spreadsheet).  Curators can then add different types of annotation to the services within the spreadsheet such as, but not limited to, descriptions, tags, and example data.
</p>

<p>
Mass Curator currently supports the annotation of <acronym title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP</acronym> services only; a user can only add annotations to the <acronym title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP</acronym> service, the <acronym title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP</acronym> operations, and the <acronym title="Simple Object Access Protocol">SOAP</acronym> inputs and outputs.  REST service support is yet to come.
</p>

<p>
After adding annotations to the spreadsheet, curators can then use the tool to extract the annotations from the spreadsheet and upload them to the BioCatalogue.
