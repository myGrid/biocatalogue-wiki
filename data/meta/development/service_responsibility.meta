Motivation

BioCatalogue is community driven, thereby allowing any registered member to submit data to the catalogue including services that may not be developed, maintained or owned by them. By default, management privileges for such services are given to the member(called the submitter) that submitted the service. However, often the owner, maintainer, developers or anyone responsible for the service in some way would want to have these management privilegesâ€¦";}s:8:"internal";a:2:{s:5:"cache";b:1;s:3:"toc";b:1;}s:8:"relation";a:1:{s:10:"firstimage";s:0:"";}}s:10:"persistent";a:5:{s:4:"date";a:2:{s:7:"created";i:1268991917;s:8:"modified";i:1269015830;}s:7:"creator";s:4:"Eric";s:11:"last_change";a:7:{s:4:"date";i:1269015830;s:2:"ip";s:14:"130.88.195.202";s:4:"type";s:1:"E";s:2:"id";s:34:"development:service_responsibility";s:4:"user";s:6:"franck";s:3:"sum";s:0:"";s:5:"extra";s:0:"";}s:11:"contributor";a:2:{s:8:"ericnzuo";s:4:"Eric";s:6:"franck";s:6:"Franck";}s:4:"user";s:0:"";}}
